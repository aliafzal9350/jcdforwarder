## 5. Implementation Rules
1. Server-First Execution: Maximize Server Components for instant Core Web Vitals and programmatic SEO crawls.
2. Structured Data: Inject JSON-LD Schema (`LogisticsService`, `FAQPage`, `SoftwareApplication`, `BreadcrumbList`) across dynamic route pages.
3. No Placeholders: Use real transit data, verified port pairs, and actual company credentials.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
