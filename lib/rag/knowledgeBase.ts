4. Chargeable Weight Principle:
   • Airlines and carriers charge on the MAX of [Actual Gross Weight] vs [Volumetric Weight].
   • Example: A carton of 60 x 50 x 40 cm weighing 15 kg has volumetric weight of (60×50×40)/6000 = 20 kg. Chargeable weight is 20 kg.`,

• CIF (Cost, Insurance & Freight): Supplier pays ocean freight and basic maritime insurance to destination port. Buyer handles destination port fees (THC), customs clearance, duties, and inland delivery. (Warning: Suppliers often use low CIF rates with exorbitant hidden destination kickback fees).
• DAP (Delivered At Place): Seller/forwarder transports goods to buyer's door, but buyer is responsible for import customs clearance, duties, and local taxes.
• DDP (Delivered Duty Paid): The most comprehensive term. JCD Forwarder handles factory pickup, export customs, ocean/air linehaul, destination customs clearance, payment of all import tariffs/duties, and final delivery to buyer's door or Amazon FBA warehouse.`,
