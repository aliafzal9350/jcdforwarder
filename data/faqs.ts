    question: 'What is Amazon FBA first-leg shipping (Head-haul logistics)?',
    answer:
      "Amazon FBA first-leg logistics encompasses the complete supply chain journey from your Chinese manufacturer's factory floor to the designated Amazon fulfillment center (FC) worldwide. This pipeline includes factory pickup, export customs clearance in China, international multimodal transit (Air DDP, Sea DDP, or Rail DDP), destination customs clearance, and final-mile scheduled delivery via Amazon Carrier Central (CARP) appointments or integrated parcel carriers (UPS, FedEx, DPD).",

    question: 'How does Amazon FBA first-leg shipping differ from traditional commercial freight?',
    answer:
      "Unlike traditional B2B consignees, Amazon is merely a fulfillment host and will never act as the Importer of Record (IOR), will not pay duties or VAT, and will outright refuse freight arriving without an Amazon Reference ID or pre-booked dock appointment. JCD provides complete Delivered Duty Paid (DDP) solutions: we act as the customs clearing entity, pay all tariffs upfront, prepare compliant pallets, and book strict CARP delivery windows.",

      'Amazon fulfillment centers enforce stringent dock safety standards: delivery vehicles must not exceed 4.2m in height and must be equipped with a functional hydraulic tailgate capable of handling pallet jacks. Drivers must wear high-visibility safety vests, steel-toed footwear, and immediately surrender vehicle ignition keys to Amazon dock staff upon backing into the bay until unloading is fully certified.',

      'Standard Amazon policy mandates one PO per carton. A maximum of 5 POs is permitted inside a single master carton only if products for each PO are physically bagged, separated with rigid cardboard partitions, and individually labeled with explicit internal PO tags. To prevent warehouse receiving errors and inventory misplacement, JCD strongly advises segregating distinct POs into dedicated master cartons.',

Non-scheduled turnaways incur significant return drayage fees and redelivery penalties.

(2) Cartons between 23.0 kg and 45.0 kg (50-100 lbs) must bear high-visibility 'Team Lift' labels on at least two exterior sides. (3) Cartons exceeding 45.0 kg (100 lbs) require 'Mechanical Lift' (Mech Lift) warning stickers. (4) Cartons containing jewelry or watches must not exceed 18.0 kg (40 lbs).

      "The Importer Security Filing (ISF 10+2) is mandated by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) for ocean container shipments. Ten specific data elements from the importer and two from the carrier must be filed electronically at least 24 hours prior to the vessel loading at the Chinese port of origin. Failure to file or late filing results in a statutory civil penalty of $5,000 USD per violation, mandatory customs hold, and invasive non-intrusive container X-ray exams at the US arrival port.",

All battery shipments must have a valid UN38.3 test summary report, 1.2m drop test certification, and an authentic Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS).

    answer:
      'The terms define the exact point where risk and cost transfer from seller to buyer: (1) EXW (Ex Works): Seller only makes goods available at factory floor; buyer bears all freight, customs, and risk. (2) FOB (Free on Board): Seller pays domestic trucking and Chinese export customs onto the vessel; buyer pays ocean freight and destination costs. (3) CIF (Cost, Insurance & Freight): Seller pays ocean freight and marine insurance to destination port; buyer clears destination customs and pays tariffs. (4) DDU (Delivered Duty Unpaid / DAP): Seller delivers to destination door, but buyer must clear customs and pay duties. (5) DDP (Delivered Duty Paid): Seller/Forwarder handles 100% of the chain, including export, international freight, destination customs clearance, duties, taxes, and door delivery.',

    answer:
      "DDP provides an all-inclusive single invoice covering freight, customs duties, port charges, and final-mile delivery. Because Amazon fulfillment centers and Shopify end-customers refuse to pay import taxes or handle clearance paperwork, DDP eliminates clearance friction, prevents cargo abandonment at border ports, and provides sellers with 100% landed cost predictability before launching marketing campaigns.",

The House Bill of Lading (HBL) is issued by JCD Forwarder to the actual cargo owner/importer.

In the United States, strict regional density ratios apply: (1) US West Coast Base Ports (Los Angeles / Long Beach / Oakland): Standard ocean ratio of 1 CBM : 1,000 kg.

(2) Express Courier (DHL/FedEx/UPS): Chargeable Weight (kg) = (Length x Width x Height in cm) / 5,000. (3) Ocean LCL Volume (CBM) = (Length x Width x Height in cm) / 1,000,000.

(2) The Central Corridor: Exits China via Erenhot Port in Inner Mongolia, traversing Mongolia to connect with the Trans-Siberian line.
